# Jenskins-Casc
## (Configurations as Code)
This is a simple example of a Jenkins installation using the configuration-as-code-plugin.
'casc.yaml' has all of the relevant configurations and the jobs.
'plugins.txt' has the list of plugins to be installed,
and Dockerfile will allow docker to build an image using the CasC configuration.
